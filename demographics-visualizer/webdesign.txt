When zooming in, should change automatically to county shapes, when zooming out to nation shapes
Selecting another shape mode should keep that mode active all the time
When selecting a nation, state, or county, should show that county's details in the county info panel, and pairwise similarity between that county and all others
When right clicking, should deselect the selected object
Hovering over a map entity, should show the name of the entity. If the entity is shaded, should show the value.
Zooming with scroll wheel or pinch, panning with left click, middle click, or dragging.
Reset button should deselect all objects, set the shape mode to automatic, deselect from the selection box, and saccade the camera to the default position.
Selecting an object and then zooming to the next shape level should keep that object selected still. IE the borders of a state remain selected.
Selecting an object and then zooming to the previous shape level should keep the details in the info panel but not show the borders of the selected object.
Possible to have a descriptor or election year selected at the same time as a county- the details for these can be in a separate box.



PLAN:

Function before form
Map legend
Map hovering tooltips (county names)

Pretty up the controls and infobox
Make it look good on mobile

Fix legend
Make "Count of members" be "Population" when no primary selected

Allow users to click on demographics, states/counties, descriptors in the sidebar infobox.
